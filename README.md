# Advent of Code 2022
## What this?
Advent of code is a like an advent calender, but instead of candy each day, you get 2 programming problems, which is arguably better! (in my opinion).
This is my solutions to the problems in python.
## Note on running
To run the python scripts, first _cd_ to the the folder of the day that the script is in. For example, run
```
> cd Day-6
> python Stars.py
```
If you want the stars for day 6. This is because the scripts uses a relative path to the data that is in the same folder as the script.
